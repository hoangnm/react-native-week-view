# Block like events

Events that span through more than 1 day can be represented in two different ways. For example, say you have an event from _monday 15:00_ until _tuesday 17:00_. The standard way to represent this is to show the event both monday (from 15h until midnight) and tuesday (from midnight until 17h).

On the other hand, we support _block events_, which are displayed as one box even if they last more than one day.
You need to provide `eventKind: 'block'` to the event (read more about `EventItem` special fields in the [full API](../full-api/event#special-fields)).

See the following examples and applications.

## Basic example

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/block-events.png').default}>

```js title="Block Events"
const myEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Std evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 18, 15),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 19, 17),
    color: 'orange',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Std evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 12),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 15),
    color: 'seagreen',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Block evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 6, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 9, 0),
    color: 'steelblue',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    description: 'Block evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 19, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 24, 23, 0),
    color: 'darkred',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
]
```

</CodeDemo>

## Fixed timeslots

Blocks do not shrink in size when overlapping with other events, thus can be useful to display as availabilty timeslots or business hours.
See the following example, where the light green boxes can represent available times.

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/timeslots.png').default}>

```js title="Availabilty timeslots"
const timeslotFields = {
  description: '',
  color: 'rgba(0,255,0,0.2)',
  eventKind: 'block',
  style: {
    borderWidth: 0,
  },
  disablePress: true,
  disableDrag: true,
  disableLongPress: true,
};
const sampleEvents = [
  // Regular events
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Event 1',
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 15),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 16, 30),
    color: 'blue',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Event 2',
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 23, 12),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 23, 14, 30),
    color: 'orange',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Event 3',
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 12),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 16),
    color: 'red',
  },
  // Timeslot events:
  {
    id: 10,
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 20, 9),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 20, 17),
    ...timeslotFields,
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 9),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 21, 17),
    ...timeslotFields,
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 22, 9),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 22, 17),
    ...timeslotFields,
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 23, 9),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 23, 17),
    ...timeslotFields,
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    startDate: new Date(2023, 1, 24, 9),
    endDate: new Date(2023, 1, 24, 13),
    ...timeslotFields,
  },
];
```
