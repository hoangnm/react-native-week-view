# Block-like events

Regular events that span through more than 1 day are displayed with one box per day.
We introduce block events, that are always displayed as only one box, even if they last more than one day.
See the following example:

<CodeDemo
  imgSrc={require('./img/block-events.png').default}
>

```js title="Block Events"
const myEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Std evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 18, 15),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 19, 17),
    color: 'orange',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Std evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 12),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 15),
    color: 'seagreen',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Block evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 6, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 9, 0),
    color: 'steelblue',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    description: 'Block evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 19, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 24, 23, 0),
    color: 'darkred',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
]
```
