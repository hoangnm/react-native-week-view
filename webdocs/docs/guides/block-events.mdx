# Block like events

Events that span through more than 1 day can be represented in two different ways. For example, say you have an event from _monday 15:00_ until _tuesday 17:00_. The standard way to represent this is to show the event both monday (from 15h until midnight) and tuesday (from midnight until 17h). On the other hand, we support _block events_: are displayed as one box even if they last more than one day.

See the following example:

<CodeDemo
  imgSrc={require('./img/block-events.png').default}
>

```js title="Block Events"
const myEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Std evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 18, 15),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 19, 17),
    color: 'orange',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Std evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 12),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 15),
    color: 'seagreen',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Block evt1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 6, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 9, 0),
    color: 'steelblue',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    description: 'Block evt2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 20, 19, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 24, 23, 0),
    color: 'darkred',
    eventKind: 'block',
  },
]
```
