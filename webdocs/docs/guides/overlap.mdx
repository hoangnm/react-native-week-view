# Overlap handling

The library handles cases where two or more events overlap in time. By default, events are shrinked in width to fit the day (see next figure) but you can change this behavior per event to suit your needs.

<img
  src={require("./img/overlap/simple-lane.png").default}
  alt="default behavior"
  width={223}
  height={427}
/>


## Available methods

There are three way to solve overlaps: split in _lanes_ (default), _stack_ or _ignore_. Each method is shown next:

| Lane (default) | Stack | Ignore |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![lane](./img/overlap/simple-lane.png) | ![stack](./img/overlap/simple-stack.png) | ![ignore](./img/overlap/simple-ignore.png) |

To choose the method you need to provide `resolveOverlap: <method>` to each event:

```js title="Basic usage"
const method = 'lane' | 'stack' | 'ignore'
const awesomeEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Event 1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'lightblue',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Event 2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 13, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 30, 0),
    color: 'green',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Event 3',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 15, 15, 0),
    color: 'pink',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
]
```

## Advanced usage

To better suit your needs you can: use different methods for each event, and for the _stack_ method you can provide `stackKey` to create multiple stacks.
See the following examples for some use cases, and check more details in the [`EventItem` API](../full-api/event#special-fields).

### Example: lane and ignore

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/overlap/advanced-mix.png').default}>

```js title="Lane and Ignore"
const mixIgnoreWithLane = [
  {
    id: 1,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'blanchedalmond',
    description: 'Event 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'ignore',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 13, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 30, 0),
    color: 'forestgreen',
    description: 'Event 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'lane',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 15, 15, 0),
    color: 'lightgreen',
    description: 'Event 3',
    resolveOverlap: 'lane',
  },
]
```
</CodeDemo>


### Example: using stack keys
You can stack only certain events together by providing a `stackKey`:

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/overlap/advanced-mix.png').default}>

```js title="Multiple stacks"
const multipleStacks = [
  {
    id: 4,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'dodgerblue',
    description: 'EvtA 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-A',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 18, 15, 0),
    color: 'lightblue',
    description: 'EvtA 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-A',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'gold',
    description: 'EvtB 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-B',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 18, 30, 0),
    color: 'orange',
    description: 'EvtB 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-B',
  },
]
```
