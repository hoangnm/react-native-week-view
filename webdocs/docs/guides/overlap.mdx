# Overlap handling

The library handles the case when two or more events overlap in time. By default, events are shrinked in width to fit the day:

<img
  src={require("./img/overlap/simple-lane.png").default}
  alt="img"
  width={223}
  height={427}
/>

But you can change this behavior per event to suit your needs.


## Available methods

There are three way to solve overlaps: split in _lanes_ (default), _stack_ or _ignore_. See the following example:

| Lane (default) | Stack | Ignore |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![lane](./img/overlap/simple-lane.png) | ![stack](./img/overlap/simple-stack.png) | ![ignore](./img/overlap/simple-ignore.png) |

To choose the method you need to provide `resolveOverlap: <method>` to each event:

```js title="Basic usage"
const method = 'lane' | 'stack' | 'ignore'
const awesomeEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    description: 'Event 1',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'lightblue',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    description: 'Event 2',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 13, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 30, 0),
    color: 'green',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    description: 'Event 3',
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 15, 15, 0),
    color: 'pink',
    resolveOverlap: method,
  },
]
```

## Advanced usage

To better suit your needs you can: use different methods for each event, and for the _stack_ method you can provide `stackKey` to create multiple stacks. See the following examples.

### Example: lane and ignore

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/overlap/advanced-mix.png').default}>

```js title="Lane and Ignore"
const mixIgnoreWithLane = [
  {
    id: 1,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'blanchedalmond',
    description: 'Event 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'ignore',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 13, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 30, 0),
    color: 'forestgreen',
    description: 'Event 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'lane',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 21, 15, 15, 0),
    color: 'lightgreen',
    description: 'Event 3',
    resolveOverlap: 'lane',
  },
]
```
</CodeDemo>


### Example: using stack keys
You can stack only certain events together by providing a `stackKey`:

<CodeDemo imgSrc={require('./img/overlap/advanced-mix.png').default}>

```js title="Multiple stacks"
const multipleStacks = [
  {
    id: 4,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 12, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'dodgerblue',
    description: 'EvtA 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-A',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 14, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 18, 15, 0),
    color: 'lightblue',
    description: 'EvtA 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-A',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 14, 30, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 30, 0),
    color: 'gold',
    description: 'EvtB 1',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-B',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    startDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 16, 0, 0),
    endDate: new Date(2022, 6, 23, 18, 30, 0),
    color: 'orange',
    description: 'EvtB 2',
    resolveOverlap: 'stack',
    stackKey: 'type-B',
  },
]
```

</CodeDemo>
