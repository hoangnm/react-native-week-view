You can mark an event as lasting all-day to display it at the top of the week-view, right below the header.
You need to provide `allDay: true` to the event (find more details in the [`EventItem` full API](../full-api/event#special-fields)).

All-day events behave somewhat similar to regular events:

* When pressed, invoke the same handlers `onEventPress` and `onEventLongPress`
* You can provide special fields `disablePress`, `disableLongPress` and `style`
* Use props `AllDayEventComponent` and `allDayEventContainerStyle` to customize the all-day events outlook, analogous to `EventComponent` and `eventContainerStyle` for regular events (find more details in the [full props API](../full-api/week-view-props))

But also have some differences:
* Does not support drag-and-drop
* Does not support edit-mode with long press behavior
* Always behave as a block (i.e. are represented as one box)
* Overlapping configurations are ignored
* Only date is considered from `startDate` and `endDate` (times are ignored)

```js
<WeekView
  events={[
    {
      id: 1,
      startDate: new Date(2023, 2, 24, 9),
      endDate: new Date(2023, 2, 24, 11),
      color: 'blue',
      description: 'E1',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      startDate: new Date(2023, 2, 23),
      endDate: new Date(2023, 2, 23),
      color: 'brown',
      description: 'E2',
      allDay: true,
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      startDate: new Date(2023, 2, 23),
      endDate: new Date(2023, 2, 25),
      color: 'green',
      description: 'E3',
      allDay: true,
    },
  ]}
/>
```
